    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <img id="Photo" src="./images/IMG_3129.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p style="font-size: 30px;" class="Information">Hi my name is Dwayne McPherson, and I'm a 16 year-old who loves playing the piano, 
        spending time with my family, 
        and helping my teachers and classmates whenever I can. 
        I'm passionate about computers and programming, 
        and I enjoy expessing my creativity through drawing. 
        I'm always curious, eager to learn new things, 
        and excited about exploring the world of techology and art.</p>
        <br><hr class="custom-line"><br>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;" class="Information">But if is very hard... Is ok I heard many students are having a time and get stress or overwhelming to the code you did. 
            The only one is called "Celebrate Failure." 
            Is mean you fail or got stuck but is ok when we try to practice and practice at far at we go and you feel something succesful coder and never give up.
            And of course if they when to fast to code just catch to and JUST DO IT!!</p>
